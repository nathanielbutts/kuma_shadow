# Kuma Shadow

## Current Version

V0.1

## Synopsis

This is for a hardware/software project to create a player for shadowing content.  The initial intent is for Japanese text (for personal reasons), but the intent will be to have this be able to be used for any language, or really any purpose involving audio files.

## Target Platforms
- Raspberry Pi Zero
- Microcontrollers

## Concept

Language shadowing is a concept for learning a secondary language .  In it, you listen to native audio samples (smaller at first) and repeat what the speaker is saying.
